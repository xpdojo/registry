# Harbor

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts
with policies and role-based access control,
ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities,
and signs images as trusted.
Harbor, a CNCF Graduated project, delivers compliance,
performance, and interoperability to help you consistently
and securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms
like Kubernetes and Docker.
